This is a game based on "Simon".  It was my first attempt at trying to publish a game in Dragon User magazine when I was 15 years old.  However this was not possible as I did not have access to a printer.

simon_orginal.bas:  a text file of the basic code, exported from the XROAR emulator
simon_original-assembly.txt:  the 6809 assembly code used to generate the amchine code routines.  I used ALLDREAM to develop this code
simon_original.cas:  the game file which can be loaded into the XROAR emulator.

This is a game based on "Simon".  It was my first attempt at trying to publish a game in Dragon User magazine when I was 15 years old.  However this was not possible as I did not have access to a printer and these were the days before the internet, email etc.

| File | Description |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| simon_orginal.bas            | a text file of the basic code, exported from the XROAR emulator.|
| simon_original_assembly.txt  | the 6809 assembly code used to generate the machine code routines.  I used ALLDREAM to develop this code.    |
| simon_original.cas           |the game file which can be loaded into the XROAR emulator       |

To run the game:
* Download simon_original.cas to your local drive
* Paste the following URL into your browser:  https://www.6809.org.uk/xroar/online/?machine=dragon32
* Click on the File tab; Click Load;  Select the downloaded simon_original.cas file.
* Within the emulator (i.e. on the green screen)
  - Type CLOAD
  - Type RUN
